# Microsoft Graph Data Connect Information Oversharing template

Information oversharing is a security and compliance use case powered by our newly available SharePoint datasets. This template helps you validate if sensitive data was mistakenly leaked or if employees intentionally shared confidential information with malicious intent. 

## Key use cases 
- Monitor the sharing landscape and craft customer tenant policies.  
- Protect confidential client data, maintain constant compliance.  
- Scale your machine learning model with the increased volume of email data.  
- Understand risky behaviors and usage and promote employee behaviors.  
- Create monthly tenant policy adoption reports and month over month sharing trends reports.  
- Identify malicious actors and protect confidential data.  
- Set terms to watch for leakage, and categorize and assign severity levels.  
- Allow customers to better understand how secure your SharePoint is. 
- Maintain information boundaries. 
- Establish new rules based on how sensitive data is managed and classified.
