# Conversation Lineage template

[Get Started](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/dataconnect-solutions/tree/main/solutions/conversation-lineage)

## Business summary 
Use the Conversation Lineage template to gain insights into an organization's communication patterns by analyzing Microsoft 365 data with Microsoft Graph Data Connect (MGDC). 
This template teaches you the key steps and Azure technologies required to build your own MGDC-based application. By extracting and processing Microsoft 365 data and runnning analytics using Azure Synapse Analytics, you can process both historical data and future data using Azure Synapse triggers. You can also extract sentiment and Natural Language Processing (NLP) entities from conversations using Azure Cognitive Services, enabling you to visualize key insights with PowerBI. 

## Key use cases 
- Integrate Microsoft 365 email conversations with CRM or ticketing information to create a single view with customer sentiment analysis.  
- Leverage the power of conversation patterns to optimize efficient routing. 
- Craft compelling internal email campaigns with proven results.  
- Identify and eliminate bad communication practices.
- Measure changes in an organizationâ€™s communication patterns. 
- Reduce redirecting by determining the value that each party brings to the chain of the interaction. 
- Track whether emails are being read and shared using sentiment analysis to gauge reactions. 
- Get a view of the communications sentiment over time.  
- Find the most frequent keywords found in main titles. 
- Get a view of all your emails sent by each department, your top email senders, the total of emails sent, and the count of emails sent externally.
