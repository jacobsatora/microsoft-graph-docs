Namespace: microsoft.graph

Use this API to remove a member (user, group, or device) from an administrative unit.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

## HTTP request

```http
DELETE /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members/{id}/$ref
