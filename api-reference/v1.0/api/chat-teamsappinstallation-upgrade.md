# teamsAppInstallation in chat: upgrade

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Upgrade an [app installation](../resources/teamsappinstallation.md) within a [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Notes**:
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then effectively, the **teamsApp** installed in the meeting will get upgraded.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentForChat |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.   |
|Application |  TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat.All<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat.All<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForChat.All, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentForChat.All |

> **Notes:**
<br><sup>1</sup> These permissions cannot be used to install apps that require consent to resource-specific permissions.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /chats/{chat-id}/installedApps/{app-installation-id}/upgrade
```

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the parameters.

The following table lists additional parameters that can be used with the upgrade action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|consentedPermissionSet|[teamsAppPermissionSet](../resources/teamsapppermissionset.md)|The set of resource-specific permissions that are being consented to.|

> **Note**:
> The permissions consented to during the installation must match the resource-specific permissions defined in the [teamsAppDefinition](../resources/teamsAppDefinition.md) of the app. To get the application and delegated resource-specific permissions, see [Example 7](../api/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps.md#example-7-list-applications-with-a-given-id-and-return-only-the-resource-specific-permissions-required-by-the-app). If only delegated resource-specific permissions are specified in the **teamsAppDefinition**, permissions can be omitted in the request body.
